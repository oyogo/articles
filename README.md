# Documentations  
This repository contains a collection folders with articles I have written for the sake of reproducibility and knowledge sharing, they touch on a number of topics including ;

  * Data visualization   
  * Dashboard development with R Shiny  
  * Deployment of RShiny dashboards  
  * Database management (MySQL)  
  * Docker technology  
  * System operations such as data transfer   
  * Documentations for projects  
     
  The documentations have overtime proved to be useful whenever I've wanted to trace back the steps and approaches I used to solve a given problem, create a system, develop a software or a tackle a programming issue. The articles are written such that any other person might find them useful.  
I am maintaining a blog of this articles accessible through [ this link](https://oyogo.github.io/).
