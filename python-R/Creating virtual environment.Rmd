Open the terminal and run the following code  

    python3 -m venv ~/.venvs/myenv  
    
_For that to work we have assumed you already have python3 installed_    


Activate the virtual environment  

    source ~/.venvs/myenv/bin/activate   
  

Install the libraries listed in the requirements.txt file  

    pip install -r requirements.txt
