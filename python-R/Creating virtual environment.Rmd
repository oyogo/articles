```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

Open the terminal and run the following code  

    python3 -m venv ~/.venvs/myenv  
    
_For that to work we have assumed you already have python3 installed_    


Activate the virtual environment  

    source ~/.venvs/myenv/bin/activate   
  

Install the libraries listed in the requirements.txt file  

    pip install -r requirements.txt  
    
    
Open vscode and press ctrl + shift + p, on the dropdown list that appears select python interpreter and choose the python version on the virtual environment that was created.
